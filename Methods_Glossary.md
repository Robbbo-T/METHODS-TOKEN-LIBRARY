  - Increases system reliability and safety.
  - Ensures continuous operation even if one component fails.

- **Example in GAIA AIR:**
  - Implementing redundant electrical power systems and multiple electric propulsion motors on the **A360XWLRGA** model to maintain functionality in case of a motor failure.

- **Related to:** [Distributed Electric Propulsion](#distributed-electric-propulsion) and [Electrical (ELE)](#ele-electrical)

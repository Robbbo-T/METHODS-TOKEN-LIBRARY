# Methods Token Library (MTL)

**A Unified Standard for Referencing and Managing Aerospace & Defense Methods**

Welcome to the Methods Token Library (MTL) repository. This project provides a scalable, standardized framework for referencing common procedures, tasks, and methods used throughout the aerospace and defense industries. By leveraging MTL tokens, technical documentation becomes more consistent, maintainable, and easily updated—improving overall quality, safety, and efficiency.

## What is MTL?

The MTL is a global reference system where industry-standard methods (e.g., maintenance procedures, inspection techniques, calibration steps) are stored as discrete, version-controlled “tokens.” Each token represents a single, reusable method. Instead of repeatedly rewriting identical instructions across multiple manuals or data modules, you reference the appropriate token from the MTL.

## Key Features

- **Standardized Methods:** Each method token follows a controlled naming and versioning scheme.  
- **Single-Source Updates:** Revise a method once in the MTL, and all documents referencing it align automatically with the new standard.  
- **Interoperability:** The MTL integrates seamlessly with S1000D, ATA chapters, and emerging aerospace standards. It’s vendor-agnostic and domain-neutral, making it suitable for OEMs, operators, MROs, and regulators.  
- **Support for Advanced Technologies:** Handle new complexities such as Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM), Quantum Computing Modules (QCM), or Blockchain-based secure data (BIT) without redefining the entire documentation strategy.

## Repository Structure

- **`/docs`**: Comprehensive documentation for MTL definitions, guidelines, and usage examples.  
  - `MTL_Standard.md`: Detailed specification of the MTL format, code structure, and lifecycle governance.  
  - `Methods_Glossary.md`: A controlled vocabulary and acronym dictionary, following Simplified Technical English (STE) principles for clarity and consistency.  
  - `Examples/`: Sample method tokens, reference data modules, and integration scenarios.  
- **`/schema`**: Proposed XML/JSON schemas and APIs for integrating MTL tokens into authoring tools, CMS, or IoT platforms.  
- **`/tools`**: Scripts, validators, and utilities to help authors and developers search for tokens, compare versions, and generate documentation stubs.

## Naming Convention

Each token follows a structured code:
```
MT-<DOMAIN>-<METHODID>-<VERSION>
```
- `MT`: Methods Token prefix.
- `<DOMAIN>`: Domain code (e.g., NDT for Non-Destructive Testing, MFG for Manufacturing steps).
- `<METHODID>`: Unique identifier for the method (e.g., CLEAN001, ULTRAS-INS).
- `<VERSION>`: Version control (e.g., V01, V02).

**Example:** `MT-NDT-ULTRAS-INS-V01` represents a standard ultrasonic inspection method, version 1.

## Integration with S1000D and ATA

- **S1000D:** Reference tokens in Maintenance Procedures (MP), Operation Procedures (OP), or System Descriptions (SD) data modules. Instead of including full instructions, just write:  
  *“Perform ultrasonic inspection as per `MT-NDT-ULTRAS-INS-V01`.”*
  
- **ATA Chapters:** Align methods with ATA chapters (e.g., ATA24 for electrical, ATA27 for flight controls). This synergy ensures consistent referencing across traditional and modern frameworks.

## Dictionary and Simplified Technical English (STE)

We maintain a **Dictionary/Glossary** following STE guidelines to ensure clarity and comprehension. The dictionary standardizes terms, acronyms, and phrases, reducing ambiguity and enabling global teams—both human and AI-driven—to easily interpret instructions.

**See:** [`docs/Methods_Glossary.md`](./docs/Methods_Glossary.md)

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from aerospace OEMs, airlines, MROs, regulatory bodies, and independent experts. You can:

- **Propose New Methods:** Add new tokens and submit a pull request. Include rationale, domain, and usage context.  
- **Suggest Improvements to Existing Methods:** If a method changes due to new regulations or updated best practices, propose a version increment and update relevant metadata.  
- **Expand the Dictionary:** Submit terms that adhere to STE rules and help unify language across the industry.

Before contributing, review [`MTL_Standard.md`](./docs/MTL_Standard.md) and follow the coding conventions and approval processes described there.

## Contact & Community

- **Issues & Requests:** Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or discuss improvements.  
- **Mailing List / Forum:** (Planned) We will set up a dedicated forum or mailing list for deeper discussions on MTL governance and best practices.  
- **Workshops & Working Groups:** If you represent a consortium, regulatory entity, or industry group interested in adopting MTL, please open a GitHub issue or contact the maintainers directly.

## Future Roadmap

- **API Integration:** Provide REST/GraphQL interfaces for real-time retrieval of methods.  
- **Blockchain-Verified Updates:** Integrate with GAA-BIT for tamper-proof versioning.  
- **IoT & AR/VR Tools:** Connect tokens with AR-based maintenance apps, enabling real-time instructions to be pulled from the MTL library.

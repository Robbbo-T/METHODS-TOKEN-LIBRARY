## Title

Electrical System Maintenance Procedure - Multimeter Usage and Verification

## Purpose

Provide standardized steps for using and verifying a multimeterâ€™s accuracy when performing electrical maintenance tasks on the A360XWLRGA model. This ensures consistent and reliable fault isolation, wiring checks, and connector inspections.

## Applicability

- Aircraft Model: A360XWLRGA  
- All electrical maintenance tasks involving voltage, current, or resistance measurements.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure the multimeter is calibrated using `MT-CAL-MULTI-V01` before measurements.
- Confirm that `MT-ELE-WIRING-CHK-V02` or `MT-ELE-CONN-V01` tasks are planned if wiring or connector inspections are required.

## Tools & Equipment

- Multimeter (calibrated)  
- Insulated probes and leads  
- PPE: Safety glasses, gloves

## Safety Notes

1. **Power Off Before Measurements:**  
   De-energize circuits to avoid electric shock.
   
2. **Use Proper Range Settings:**  
   Selecting the incorrect range may damage the multimeter or produce inaccurate results.

3. **Follow Approved Procedures:**  
   Adhere to OEM and regulatory guidelines.

## Procedure Steps

1. **Setup:**
   - Retrieve the calibrated multimeter from the tool crib.
   - Verify calibration date and ensure it is within the allowed interval as per `MT-CAL-MULTI-V01`.

2. **Verification of Instrument:**
   - Check leads and probes for damage or wear.
   - Perform a quick continuity test on a known resistor or reference to confirm readings are within tolerance.

3. **Performing Measurements:**
   - For voltage checks: Connect leads to the appropriate terminals, select correct range, and record readings.
   - For continuity or resistance checks: Ensure circuit is isolated, measure resistance against known values.
   - If readings are outside expected values, refer to `MT-ELE-WIRING-CHK-V02` or `MT-ELE-CONN-V01` to inspect wiring or connectors.

4. **Record Keeping:**
   - Document all findings in the maintenance logbook.
   - Note any discrepancies and schedule further inspections or component replacements if necessary.

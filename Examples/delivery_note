Note:
The above Markdown files demonstrate how to integrate references between methods (MT-CAL-MULTI-V01, MT-ELE-WIRING-CHK-V02, MT-ELE-CONN-V01) and a related S1000D Data Module (GAA-2400-MP-00-E-0003). Each file follows the standardized format, references regulatory compliance, ATA chapters, and integrates with digital tools (IoT, AR/VR) and the MTL framework, ensuring consistency and interoperability across your documentation ecosystem.
